After commencement of the event the robot is allowed to expand for using the external mechanisms to perform the tasks.The robot can be either wired or wireless.The electrical voltage anywhere in the robot should not be more than 24V (summation of all batteries should be equal to 24V) at any point of time. Robot weight should not exceed 4 Kg. The robot should preferably have a dual frequency remote control circuit or two control circuits, which could be interchanged, before the start of the game to avoid frequency interference from other teams. The robot must not be made from Lego parts or any ready-made assembly kits. Judging for the same will be strict and the contestant will be IMMEDIATELY DISQUALIFIED if any violation is found. Sticker having robot name should be clearly visible on the body of the robot.No AC supply will be allowed. Both teams will stand outside to the arena so that minimum length of the electric wire should be 8 meters. "

Final round will be a surprise round (the track could be different from the previous rounds).There will be obstacles in the path like bumps, sharp turns, slopes, steps, pits over which the robot would have to jump over( only with its speed, no jumping mechanism required), other physical moving obstacles.  Note: Arena or track change will be informed soon."
