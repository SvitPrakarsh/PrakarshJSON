			"sectionContent": "Personal robotic assistants help reducing the manual efforts being put by human in their dayto-day tasks . We develop a voice controlled personal assistant robot. The human voice command is given to the robotic assistant remotely, by using a smart mobile phone. The robot can perform different movements like, turn, start/stop operations. The voice commands are processed in real-time, using an online cloud server. The speech signal command converted to text form is communicated to the robot over a Bluetooth network. The personal assistant robot is developed on a micro-controller based platform"
